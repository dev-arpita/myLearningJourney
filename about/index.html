                    <h2 class="question">How I stay commited to learning</h2>
                    <p class="answer">I like to think myself as a lifelong learner. I use to spend hours and hours learning.
                        Then try to create simple projects using awhat I learned or work
                        new techniques into existing projects. <br />
                        while that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things
                        about my journey with the world
                    </p>

                <div class="question-two">
                    <h2 class="question">How I got started</h2>
                    <p class="answer">I started simple and gradually grew my learning Journal site. I would take notes about
                        what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my
                        notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using
                        my own words.<br />
                        That I helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was
                        also helping others learn and stay motivated.
